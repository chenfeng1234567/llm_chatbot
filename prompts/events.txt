2002, G, 2:07 Meta 72, R.T. 84%/70% The Rookie (2002) is a sports drama based on the true story of Jim Morris, a high school chemistry teacher and baseball coach in small-town Texas. Once a promising pitcher whose career was cut short by injuries, Morris challenges his struggling team to work harder by promising to try out for the major leagues if they win the district championship. When the team unexpectedly succeeds, he keeps his word and discovers that, despite being in his mid-30s, his fastball is faster than ever. Against the odds, Morris earns a spot with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, making his long-delayed dream of playing in Major League Baseball a reality, while inspiring his students, family, and community.

2024 Meta 93 R.T. 100%/91% Everywhere you look, they are women living on their own, making their life work in spite of long hours at their jobs, thwarted love, loneliness. In Payal Kapadia’s gorgeous study of friendship and tensions that sometimes come with, three women in modern Mumbai chart their own bumpy roads: Praha, a nurse, is married but she hasn’t heard from her absentee husband in years. Fellow nurse Any is secretly involved with a Muslim man, which she must hide from her Hindu family and just about everybody at all costs. And Parvaty is an older hospital worker who loses her home because the property’s paperwork is in her late husband’s name. All of these women have come from small villages to work, to make money, to do things their own way. The director captures the texture of their lives as well as the glittery, gritty poetry of the city around them.
